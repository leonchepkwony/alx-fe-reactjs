# Fundamentals and Core Concepts of React

This project is designed to showcase the foundational knowledge I acquired while learning **React**, a powerful JavaScript library used for building interactive user interfaces. Through hands-on activities, I explored how to set up, build, and manage basic React applications and components. 

## üöÄ Project Overview

During this learning journey, I gained practical experience in:

- Setting up a React development environment
- Writing components using JSX
- Passing data through props
- Managing component state
- Building modular, reusable UI components

## üìö Objectives and What I Learned

### ‚úÖ Understand the Basics of React

- I learned what React is and its value in modern web development.
- I understood how to initialize a React application using the `create-react-app` tool.
- I became familiar with the structure of a typical React project and how it fits into a larger web development workflow.

### ‚úÖ Familiarize with ReactDOM and JSX

- I learned how `ReactDOM` is responsible for rendering React components to the DOM.
- I explored **JSX** (JavaScript XML), a syntax extension that allows writing HTML elements within JavaScript code.
- I practiced creating UI structures using JSX for better readability and efficiency.

### ‚úÖ Create and Manage React Components

- I created various types of components, particularly **functional components**.
- I learned the basics of the component lifecycle and how state and props affect rendering behavior.
- I managed state using the `useState` hook to create dynamic and interactive components.

### ‚úÖ Build and Modify React Applications

- I built a React application from scratch using `create-react-app`.
- I modified existing components to meet specific requirements and improve user experience.
- I applied styling and logical behavior to personalize components.

### ‚úÖ Work with Props to Pass Data

- I learned how to define and pass **props** between parent and child components.
- I created a **User Profile Card** that dynamically displays user information using props.

### ‚úÖ Integrate Multiple Components

- I assembled multiple components into a main application component.
- I ensured smooth data flow and functional integration between components to create a cohesive application interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Technologies Used

- React JS
- JSX
- JavaScript (ES6+)
