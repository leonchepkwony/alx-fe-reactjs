# State Management in React - Recipe Sharing App

## Overview

This project is part of my Frontend Development course, focused on mastering **state management in React** using **Zustand**. I built a **Recipe Sharing Application** to demonstrate effective and scalable state handling within a React application.

## Project Summary

In the “State Management in React” project, I learned to manage state effectively in a React application using **Zustand**. This project covered essential concepts and techniques for state management, culminating in the creation of a **Recipe Sharing Application**. By integrating Zustand, I enhanced my ability to manage complex state interactions in a scalable and maintainable way.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project:

### ✅ I understood and utilized Zustand for State Management:
- I learned the basics of Zustand and how to integrate it into a React application for efficient state management.

### ✅ I managed state with Zustand:
- I implemented and managed application state using Zustand, including creating stores and defining state actions.

### ✅ I explored advanced Zustand features:
- I utilized advanced features of Zustand to handle more complex state management scenarios.

### ✅ I built a Recipe Sharing Application using Zustand:
- I applied my knowledge by building a functional application that includes:
  - Adding recipes
  - Editing recipes
  - Deleting recipes
  - Managing recipe data entirely using Zustand for state management

## Technologies Used

- React
- Zustand
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- CSS Modules / Tailwind (if applicable)
- Vite (for project setup)

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/recipe-sharing-app.git
   cd recipe-sharing-app
